# Gaea

[Gaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia) is a personal timepiece and life-time keeping device based on Earth's [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period). It indicates years, months, days and current time in Gaea format.

## Format

Gaea calendar starts with your birth timestamp in Gregorean format and moves in sync with the Earth from then. Each day corresponds to 1 angular degree around the Sun. A year has **12 months**, **30 days** each and as such, doesn't respect Gregorean calendar days and is out of phase with day/night cycles.
There are no hours or minutes in Gaea, a day lasts `360` units, which is equal to `87661536` milliseconds.
Year index is zero-based.
